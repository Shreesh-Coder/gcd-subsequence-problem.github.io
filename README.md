Problem statement

"X loved his friend Y very much. Z was jealous of X's friendship. So, he kidnapped Y. X started searching Y and found a note 
which was written by Z. In that note, Z asked X to solve a problem if he wanted his friend back. The note had the following 
problem. Given some numbers , X had to find the number of subsequences such that the greatest common divisor of all 
numbers in subsequence lies between ""L"" and ""R""(both inclusive). Note: A sub-sequence can be obtained from the 
original sequence by deleting 0 or more integers from the original sequence.
Input:
First line contains an integer ""t"" , denoting the number of testcases. First line of each test has an integer ""N"". Second line 
contains ""N"" space separated integers. Third line contains two integers ""L"" and ""R"".
Output:
Print the answer of above described problem in a new line for each testcase.
Constraints:
1 <= t <= 1000
1 <= N <= 50
1 <= numbers <= 10^5
1 <= L,R <= 100
L <= R"
